    "DC Security Constrained Optimal Power \n",
    "Flow (DC-SCOPF) is a key problem in power systems operations for determining the optimal operation set points of controllable power injections in the event of possible contingencies. This problem can be formulated as a constrained optimization problem for minimizing the cost of power injection under the physical constraints of the power system. The timescale for these systems can range from a day before to near-real time. As more contingencies are considered - the scale of the problem can quickly grow. Thus, quickly and robustly solving DC-SCOPF remains an open challenge. Interior Point Methods (IPM) have been shown to be an effective means of solving the DC-SCOPF effectively taking advantage of the structure of the problem to achieve efficient convergence <sup>[[1]](#Chiang2015), [[2]](#PDIP)</sup>. However, one of the major bottlenecks that is a large spares matrix inversion is needed at each Newton Step. In this work, we use multi-grid solvers which have been successful in solving PDEs and develop a hierarchical parallel model with distributed and shared memory parallel architectures for expediting the calculation of the Newton step in DC-SCOPF.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is our work different from other words that tackle this problem?<a name=\"HowWorkIsDifferent\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Of late, multiple works have used Interior Point Methods in order to solve the DC-SCOPF optimization problem (linear program) <sup>[[1]](#Chiang2015), [[2]](#PDIP)</sup>. Given that the matrices associated with power systems are sparse, specialized interior point method (IPM) solvers need to be developed for security constrained optimal power flow (DC-SCOPF). Such structure exploiting IPMs usually are plagued by a bottleneck of taking large/sparse inverses. \n",
    "To address this, we explore how to leverage ideas from multigrid solvers for improving computational efficiency of IPMs for DC-SCOPF. Algebraic multigrid (AMG) has drawn much interest for scaling performance. <sup>[[3]](#PARMS)</sup> On the other hand, there is a lack of work on developing multilevel solvers for sparse matrices associated with power systems, which demonstrate specific connectivity from the physical system. In this work, we develop a multilevel solver specifically crafted for the strongly local structure of the DC-SCOPF problem and at the same time, propose an efficient distributed solving scheme that takes advantage of the inherent local block nature of the system to effectively parallelize the solving procedure."

The first step is to then determine the full system under a given number of contingencies. In this case, we need to additionally generate power flow constraints with respect to the new contingencies that are introduced into the circuit.\n",

    "$100000\\times100000$ and hence, generating a parallel solution for such a system is a solid proof of concept in itself. Since the original system without the contingencies is not big enough for a huge memory requirement and the contingencies themselves originate independently and are later connected only with the power flow dynamics of the system, this is equivalent to running a \"for\" loop iteration in a serial version where the components of the \"for\" loop have no disruption on each other.Thus, we can generate the entire system for all contingencies in a shared memory architecture using PyMP. The expected theoretical speedup for this setting should be approximately K(=6) in our case since the system is generated. This step of parallelization is a case of **weak scaling**, where we can increase the number of processes as the problem size in terms of the number of contingencies grow. In the process flow diagram shown in Figure 3, this step can be seen as the first step that generates the initial level 0 system $A^0$ from the base case system matrix A in a shared memory parallel setup across $K(=6)$ contingencies.\n",

    "The reason why a general system of equations cannot be inverted effectively in a completely distributed setting because of the dependence of variables among many other variables if the system is underpinned by a strongly connected graph. This would entail significant communication and synchronization overheads and any advantage gained out of potential parallelization could be lost. On the other hand, it is well-known that power systems have strong intrinsic local sub-structures as all buses are not expected to be connected to all the other buses. In such a setting, any solver that we build should take advantage of this fact and specialized multi-level methods need to be devised. In particular, we plan to design the system with maximum independence possible when distributed into local systems so that most number of variables could be solved while at the same time, minimizing the necessity of communication and synchronization to the best extent possible.\n",

    "The main reason why solving linear systems cannot be done effectively in a distributed fashion is because of the dependence of the system variables on each other. In such a case, all processors need to communicate all their owned variables to all the other processors (in the worst case, this would mean that every processor needs every variable), making communication and synchronization costs overshoot the effects of parallelization. The same effect would be observed in our distributed multi-level system too if we implement parallelization by arbitrarily dividing the set of variables into processors without thinking about the overheads.\n",

Our choice of permutation matrix that reorients the system in order to partition the set of variables into base case variables, contingency variables and the power injection variables ensured that strongly locally connected variables were part of the same processor and thus, communication and synchronization overheads were reduced drastically providing us good speedups overall, allowing us to realize the power of parallelization.

To ensure that such a communication and synchronization is possible, we leveraged **MPI's gather, broadcast, and scatter** communication modules.  These modules were used specifically to ensure that the power injection processor continually receive interface information from all the power injections while broadcasting it's own interface to the remaining processors. Also, in all our MPI implementations, we also learned to use **mpi4py** which is a Python equivalent of C-based MPI we learned in class with minor differences in attributes.\n"

This result provides us two valuable learning outcomes - parallelizing the major bottleneck always has the most significant overall value to the speedup and the value of effective design of a partitioning scheme that enhances the independence of the processors and reduces the the communication messages for transferring the  interface variables. The other two parallel blocks (1 and 2), while they provided similar speedups (in terms of percentages) as the terminal solver, were not instrumental for the overall speedups since their serial run-times were not as high as compared to the terminal step as one can observe from the serial code profiling graph. \n",

Thus, from our experiments, we realize that the need for parallelization always depends on the computational workload that each problem component warrants and thus, grows with the problem size.\n",

Given that this process runs iteratively in the distributed implementation (between the contingency and power injection processors), there are multiple iterative solves of the interface variables and multiple significant communication/synchronization steps - an ill-conditioned matrix can lead to accumulating residuals in an iterative process like ours and could be a reason for our residuals to be non-trivial.  Further work needs to be done to improve the numerical accuracy of the solution - mostly by investing efforts in designing a more thorough preconditioning schemes. It is worth noting, however, that typical built-in direct solvers (scipy.sparse etc.) also tend to perform fairly poorly - and in general across all sparse solvers, getting better handles of condition numbers of a sparse operations is a standard issue when working with this type of structure.\n",

    "### Lessons Learned <a name =\"LessonsLearned\"></a>\n",
    "The first lesson we learned by implementing real-world parallel systems is that blind parallelism is counterproductive and can make the system slower than the serial version. One needs to extensively think and analyze about parallel design before implementation. The first step involves identifying all possible overheads by profiling and ensure that the design guarantees as much independence as possible in the system. In a nutshell, we found that more independence between the processors meant that parallelization was more effective and scalable. The next key lesson is that scaling analysis is always an important aspect of performance evaluation. Many times, we found that the system behaved significantly differently for 1 contingency vs. 6 contingencies in terms of overheads etc. and one needs to ensure that the parallel design is robust enough to scale with an increasing problem size guaranteeing similar properties in terms of time, efficiency etc. This exercise also helped us to develop good practices for parallelizing any real-world application. In the process, we learned and adopted the workflow - profile the base version, identify the inefficiencies and optimize the serial code followed by profiling exercise once again and then, find avenues to parallelize and implement good parallel design and finally, profile to complete one iteration of the process. Any real-world problem entails multiple iterations of this process. Also, beyond the parallelization scope, we also learned significantly about issues on numerical stability, ill-conditioned matrices, robust solvers and accumulating residuals with iterative solvers in an attempt to solve our sparse system.\n",

This scheme demonstrates well-engineered load balancing with minimal communication and synchronization overheads by exploiting the system's sparse structure and  significantly speeds up the critical Newton Step for sufficiently large problems. Further work will explore means to improve accuracy by imploring more preconditioning techniques to improve stability.\n",

    "We evaluated our code through a check on the residuals of the solution. This was computed via the frobenius norm of $ A  x  - B $ where $x$ is the proposed solution by a solver. The implementation of this can be found in the function calculate residuals in the utils library in the solvers library https://github.com/Srivatsan-Srinivasan/cs205-final-project/blob/master/solvers/utils.py} and examples of how to invoke our residual profiler can be found in the example scripts. For example,  see the multilevel_check_residuals function (in https://github.com/Srivatsan-Srinivasan/cs205-final-project/blob/master/profile_multilevel_example.py) or the check_residuals functions implemented in the profiler utilities (in https://github.com/Srivatsan-Srinivasan/cs205-final-project/blob/master/profile_baseline_example.py).\n",

    "We noticed that our solvers were plagued by non-trivial residuals. Upon further investigation, we determined that the root cause seemed to be driven by system specific details. An simple direct solve implementation of the solvers using purely the Scipy library and an implementation of the multigrid solver purely in MATLAB all demonstrated similar non trivial residuals. \n",

    "### Software Design and How to Use Our Software <a name=\"SoftwareDesign\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our software implements several version of newton step solvers. The solvers can be run at several different extents of parallelism. All versions of the implements solvers expose a very similar interface. The implementation of the solvers can be found in the 'solvers' folder. Notice that all the solvers, the baseline solver, the serial solver (with optional parallelism at block 1), the parallel solver (with optional parallelism at block 1 and 3) implement a set of common functions that all solvers should have. Namely, all solvers implement the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **load\\_data()** Providers a unified interface for loading the necessary data sets for all solvers. Loads the necessary data files to setup the problem for a provided number of buses and contingencies for the power network.\n",
    "2. **construct\\_newton()** Provides a relatively consistent interface for constructing the newton matrix for the newton step solvers. The function takes in the loaded data sets and constructs the newton matrix. For the solvers that implement block 1 level parallelism, the function optionally takes in parameters that define the degree of parallelism (e.g. number of workers for PyMP, etc.)\n",
    "3. **solver()** This function is the main workhorse and actually implements the logic for the solvers. For example, the scipy solver simply implements a call to the least squares scipy function. Also the fully parallelized solver implements the multi-grid approach with full parallelization (at blocks 1, 2, 3).\n",
    "    and optionally an addition function for multilevel parallel solvers that implement the descent to lower levels.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * **descend_level()**\n",
    "    This function implements the logic to descend through block 2 in a distributed fashion and is present only in solvers that support parallelism at block 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All available implementations of the solvers are packed into the 'solvers' folder. Common functionality have been abstracted away into two files in this 'solvers' folder. These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* utils.py Here, the very generic functions such as data loading, etc. that have specific to do with the newton step problem are implemented. Most noteworthy function implemented here is the calculate_residuals() function.\n",
    "* solver_utils.py This folders implements the vast majority of the underlying logic for the solvers. For example, you'll find the actual implementation of the multilevel solvers here (see multigrid(), multigrid_parallel(), multigrid_full_parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, in the parent folder, you'll find the necessary scripts to easily run these solvers and to profiler them. Notably, for each solver implemented in the 'solver' folder, you'll find two scripts, one to run the solver and another to easily profile these solvers. For example, to view an example usage for the fully parallelized multigrid solver (solver/solver_multilevel.py), you can refer to the simple driver script that just runs the solver for some power network (multilevel_example.py) or the driver script to run the available profilers for the solver (profile_multilevel_example.py). Below are listed the driver scripts and profiler driver scripts.\n",

    "1. solver/solver_multilevel.py\n",
    "        1. multilevel_example.py\n",

    "\n",
    "Again, the common profiler utilities have been moved into profiler library file profile\\_utils.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, again, for the fully parallelized multilevel solver, running with a bus size of 2224 and 6 contingencies with parallelization at blocks 1, 2, 3, to just run the solver, you would do `python multilevel_example.py` and to run different profilers on the script, you would edit the profiler driver script and run it, `python profile_multilevel_example.py`.
